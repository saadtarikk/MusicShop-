You are being asked to model a music shop. This shop will contain items which can be sold. These items might be instruments, which someone may play e.g. guitar, saxaphone, piano, etc, or, they might be other items, e.g. guitar strings, drum sticks, sheet music etc. Each item which can be sold will have both a price at which the shop bought the item, and a price at which the item will be sold.

Using the calculateMarkup method for each item in stock, create a method which gives the total potential profit for the shop.
Create and use an enum for instrument types e.g. keyboard, wind, brass etc
Any other extensions you may wish to add.
